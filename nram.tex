\section{Neural Random Access Machines} \label{nram}
In this section we briefly recall the NRAM model presented in \cite{NRAM:2016}.  
This model can be included in the recent research trend of learning algorithms \cite{Graves2014NeuralTM,greve2016evolving,Joulin2015InferringAP,zaremba:2016,zaremba:2015}.
Like others, NRAM model is an implementation of the controller-interface abstraction: it uses a neural controller as a ``processor'' and provide different interfaces for input, output and memory. 

In particular the NRAM model can learn to solve problems that require explicit manipulation and dereferencing of pointers. 
 The controller, the core part of the NRAM model can be a feedforward neural network or an LSTM, and it is the only
trainable part of the model.
