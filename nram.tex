\section{Neural Random Access Machines}
In this section we briefly recall the NRAM model presented in \cite{NRAM:2016}.  
This model can be included in the recent research trend producing models able to learn algorithms \cite{NTM,Joulin2015InferringAP}.  The core part of the model is a neural controller, which acts
as a “processor”. The controller can be a feedforward neural network or an LSTM, and it is the only
trainable part of the model.

A fundamental operation of modern computers is pointer manipulation and dereferencing.  In this
work, we investigate a model class that we name the Neural Random-Access Machine (NRAM),
which is a neural network that has, as primitive operations, the ability to manipulate, store in mem-
ory, and dereference pointers into its working memory. By providing our model with dereferencing
as a primitive,  it becomes possible to train models on problems whose solutions require pointer
manipulation and chasing.  Although all computationally universal neural networks are equivalent,
which means that the NRAM model does not have a representational advantage over other models if
they are given a sufficient number of computational steps, in practice, the number of timesteps that
a given model has is highly limited, as extremely deep models are very difficult to train. As a result,
the model’s core primitives have a strong effect on the set of functions that can be feasibly learned
in practice, similarly to the way in which the choice of a programming language strongly affects the
functions that can be implemented with an extremely small amount of code.
Finally, the usefulness of computationally-universal neural networks depends entirely on the ability
of backpropagation to find good settings of their parameters.  Indeed, it is trivial to define the “op-
timal” hypothesis class (Solomonoff, 1964), but the problem of finding the best (or even a good)
function in that class is intractable.  Our work puts the backpropagation algorithm to another test,
where the model is extremely deep and intricate.
In our experiments, we evaluate our model on several algorithmic problems whose solutions required
pointer manipulation and chasing. These problems include algorithms on a linked-list and a binary
tree. While we were able to achieve encouraging results on these problems, we found that standard
optimization algorithms struggle with these extremely deep and nonlinear models.  We believe that
advances in optimization methods will likely lead to better results.
